The project is divided into 7 files. Four of them are folders:

- Assets: Contains the header image.
- dist: Contains the .js file generated after transpiling .ts.
- src: Contains the .ts file and the interfaces file.
- styles: Contains the CSS file.

The remaining 3 files are the index.html, this text file, and the tsconfig.json that specifies the TS compiler settings.


Record of issues that were detected during the project’s development:

- Started working with TS without a clear understanding of its purpose and functionality.
- Prepared the project's kickoff without a clear starting point.
- Grasped the magnitude and scope of the project.
- Read the individual project document multiple times to fully comprehend the tasks.
- Understood the workings of interfaces.
- Learned about some of the features of TS.
- Try to understand enums.


Documentation of how to use the API:

This API provides information about episodes and characters from the Rick & Morty series.

- Endpoint: https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode
Each episode contains an object that, in turn, includes the following properties:

- id: Identifier for each episode.
- name: Episode name.
- air_date: Air date of the episode.
- episode: Episode code.
- characters: List of characters in each episode, which in turn contains specific details about their name, gender, status, origin, and location.


Record of lessons learned:

- Use of asynchronous functions.
- Use and internal functioning of APIs.
- - Use of interfaces (import/export).
Understanding the dynamic use of APIs.
